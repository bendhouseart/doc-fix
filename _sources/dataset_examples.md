# BIDS data

Here are some links to BIDS compliant data. Sourcedata (pre-BIDS) are sometimes
also available, these can be used to just see (or to build tutorials) of how
source data are converted to BIDS.

## BIDS examples with empty raw data files

-   Many examples can be found
    [here](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples)

## BIDS examples with data files

-   [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/): If you're looking for full data files
    to run the validator on or simply compare to your own _bidsified_ data try
    searching here. Datasets here are (by and large) publicly available and
    conform to BIDS.
