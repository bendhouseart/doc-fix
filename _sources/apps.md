# What is a BIDS App?

A [BIDS App](http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/) is an analysis pipeline that
takes a BIDS formatted dataset as input and has all of its dependencies packaged
within a container ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or
[Singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/))

## FAQ

### Which container do I use to start building my BIDS App?

The only minimum requirements of a BIDS App's container is its ability to run
your pipeline. So for example, if your app is mostly Python based it should be
sufficient to start with any image that has Python and include your pipenv
dependencies.

### I noticed that every BIDS app follows some specific arguments such as `bids_dir`, `output_dir`, and `analysis_level` and `participant_label`. Can I add more arguments?

Yes, the mandatory arguments that you have listed should be in every BIDS App,
but you are free to add more that are specific to the task your app will
perform.

### I noticed that there are 2 kinds of analysis levels --> `participant` and `group`. What does this mean?

Generally, "participant" means individual level analysis (for instance: single
subject) The group level analysis can be thought of as the second step, where
the input becomes the output of the "participant" level analysis. For example,
generating statistic maps of each subject's brain could be considered
"participant", while generating the average of these maps across the dataset
could be considered "group".

### What do we do if our application does not have any use for the group level analysis?\*\*

If your pipeline has no need for group level analysis, it is fine if it is only
valid for the analysis_level argument (see
[fmriprep](http://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html))

### Is it mandatory to first check the dataset validity using the BIDS-validator?

It is an extremely helpful feature to have validation of the dataset as part of
your tool. However, it's not considered mandatory. (for instance: I know of many
apps that just simply fail with an error message if the dataset is not BIDS
compliant)

### How do I upload my BIDS App to the BIDS-App Github org? (for instance: so that it shows up [here](http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/apps/))\*\*

You can release BIDS Apps using your own or your lab's account. However, if you
want to be added to the BIDS docker hub, please message Chris Gorgolewski to
have a repo created for you.

If you base your code on <https://github.com/BIDS-Apps/example> deployment on
docker hub will happen automatically via circleci
